### Project: Realodex

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Feature**: Edit
  * What it does: allows the user to edit client profiles.
  * Justification: Edit feature must be changed every time a new field is added to the client profile, so that users can edit every field of the client profile.
* **Feature**: Delete by index
  * What it does: allows the user to delete a client profile by index.
* **New Feature**: Delete by name
  * What it does: allows the user to delete a client profile by name.
