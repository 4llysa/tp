# Realodex User Guide

Realodex is a **desktop app for managing client contacts, optimized for use via a
Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Realodex can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Commands are generally in the format `COMMANDWORD PREFIX_ONE/UPPER_CASE PREFIX_TWO/UPPER_CASE ....`
* `COMMANDWORD` refers to the various commands user can input. <br>Examples include `add`, `delete`, `filter`. A summary of all commands and their usages can be found in the [Commands Summary](#command-summary) table.

* `COMMANDWORD` is case-insensitive, i.e.`add` and `ADD` both indicate the command word for `add`.
* `PREFIX/` refers to the prefix tag associated with each user-written input. <br>
   e.g. in `add n/NAME r/REMARK`, `NAME` is the name parameter and `REMARK` is the remark parameter.
* `PREFIX` is case-insensitive, i.e.`N/` and `n/` are the same and are used to indicate a `NAME` input.
* `PREFIX` must be preceded by a whitespace character.
   e.g. `a/6 College Avenue Westr/Has a dog` will only recognise the `a/` prefix as the `r/` prefix is preceded by `t` which is not a whitespace character.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME ....`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe ....`.
  <br>For more details on the parameters, do refer to the [Field Constraints](#field-constraints).

* Parameters enclosed in `[]` are optional to input.<br>e.g. `[r/REMARK]` indicates an optional input field for that command.

* You may input the parameters in any order (e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME a/ADDRESS`, `a/ADDRESS n/NAME` is also acceptable).

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Adding a client: `add`

Adds a client to Realodex.

<u>Format</u>: `add n/NAME p/PHONE i/INCOME e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS f/FAMILY t/TAG h/HOUSING_TYPE [r/REMARK] [b/BIRTHDAY]`

- `n/NAME`,`p/PHONE`,`i/INCOME`,`e/EMAIL`,`a/ADDRESS`,`f/FAMILY`,`t/TAG` and `h/HOUSING_TYPE` are compulsory fields.
  - If any of the above fields are missed out in the `add` command, you will receive an error message informing you of the compulsory fields that you missed.
  - For example, if only `n/NAME` and `i/INCOME` are present, you will be alerted that you are missing the fields `p/PHONE`,`e/EMAIL`,`a/ADDRESS`,`f/FAMILY`,`t/TAG`and`h/HOUSINGTYPE`.
 <a href="images/add-command/missing_fields_error.png">
   <img src="images/add-command/missing_fields_error.png" alt="missing compulsory fields" style="width:150%">
   </a>
- Except `t/TAG`, there can only be one of each field in the add command.
<a href="images/add-command/excessive_fields_error.png">
  <img src="images/add-command/excessive_fields_error.png" alt="excessive fields" style="width:100%">
  </a>
- For `t/TAG`, you may input both `t/BUYER` and/or `t/SELLER` (case insensitive).
  - If either tag is repeated more than once, for e.g. `t/BUYER t/BUYER`, the tag will only be recorded once and no error will be thrown.
- Note that the `r/REMARK` and `b/BIRTHDAY` fields are optional, enclosed in `[]`. You may choose to omit them.
  - If you include the prefix with a blank input, the birthday and remark fields will be taken as not specified.
    - Example: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 i/20000 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/4 t/Buyer h/HDB r/ b/` will successfully add John Doe but remarks and birthday will be not specified.
- Each field has constraints to the inputs it can accept. Do refer to the [Field Constraints](#field-constraints) for more information.
  - If any of the constraints are violated, you will receive an error message detailing the fields with invalid formats.
  - For example, if `n/NAME`,`p/PHONE` and `t/TAG` fields do not fulfil the contraints, you will receive 3 error messages as shown.
    <a href="parsing_errors.png">
    <img src="parsing_errors.png" alt="duplicate person" style="width:150%">
    </a>
- You **cannot** have duplicate persons with the same name in Realodex.
  - Names are case-insensitive as described in [Field Constraints](#field-constraints).
  - If you try to add duplicate persons, you will get the error message "This client already exists in Realodex".
    <a href="images/add-command/duplicate_person_error.png">
    <img src="images/add-command/duplicate_person_error.png" alt="duplicate person" style="width:100%">
    </a>

<u>Examples</u>:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 i/20000 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/4 t/Buyer h/HDB r/Owes $1000. b/27May2003`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe a/Newgate Prison i/0 f/1 p/94859694 e/betsyc@rocketmail.com t/Seller h/CONDOMINIUM t/Buyer`

### Deleting a client : `delete`

Deletes the specified client from Realodex. There are 2 ways to do so:

#### Delete By Name

<u>Format</u>: `delete n/NAME`

* Deletes the client with the specified `NAME` in Realodex.
* `NAME` is case-insensitive.
* If `NAME` is **not found**, error message will be shown "The client name provided is invalid".

<u>Example</u>:
* `delete n/Udhaya Shanmugam` deletes the client in Realodex with the name "Udhaya Shanmugam".

#### Delete By Index

<u>Format</u>: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the client of the specified `INDEX` in Realodex.
* üí° If you are currently filtered, the index will be based on the filtered list.
* If `INDEX` is **more than the number of clients in Realodex**, error message will be shown "The client index provided is invalid."
* If 'INDEX` is a non-zero unsigned integer, error message will be shown "Index is not a non-zero unsigned integer."

<u>Example</u>:
* `delete 4` deletes the 4th client listed in Realodex, provided there are 4 or more entries.

Errors:
- If neither index nor name is provided `delete` will show an error message "Please provide either an index or a name.".
- If both an index and name is provided `delete INDEX n/NAME` will show an error message "Please provide either an index or a name, not both.".
- If both an index and name is provided `delete n/NAME INDEX ` will show an error message "The client name provided is invalid" as INDEX is considered part of the NAME".
### Editing clients : `edit`

Edits specified details of the client.

<u>Format</u>: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [i/INCOME] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [f/FAMILY] [t/TAG] [h/HOUSINGTYPE] [r/REMARK] [b/BIRTHDAY]`

- If `INDEX` is `3`, the 3rd client's information will be edited.
- üí° If you are currently filtered, the index will be based on the filtered list.
- It is optional to edit any field (i.e, you can choose to edit any combination of fields so long there is at least 1).
- The current information will be overwritten with the input provided.
- When editing the `TAG`, all existing tags will be overwritten with the new tag(s) provided. If you want to edit the client to be both a buyer and seller, include both tags i.e. `t/Buyer t/Seller`.
- All fields must follow the respective [Field Constraints](#field-constraints).

<u>Examples</u>:

- `edit 1 p/999` will overwrite the 1st client's phone number to "999".
- `edit 2 n/Kylie  i/3333 f/5` will overwrite the 2nd client's name to "Kylie", income to "3333" and family size to "5".

### Filtering clients: `filter`

The filter command in Realodex allows you to narrow down your list of clients by specifying a keyphrase
related to one of the client's attributes: name, remark, tag, birthday month, or housing type.
This feature is particularly useful when you need to focus on a
subset of your client database that meets certain criteria.
Note that the search is **case-insensitive** for all input parameters.

>
> When performing multiple filter operations in sequence,
> each new filter is applied to the original, full list of clients, not the subset produced by the previous filter.
> This approach ensures clarity and consistency in search results.

#### Filter By Name
<u>Format:</u> `filter n/KEYPHRASE`

- Returns the list of clients whose names contain the specified keyphrase.
- Keyphrase input should be in valid format for names (alphanumeric) and non-empty.
  - `filter n/james` matches person with the name "James".
- **Partial fragments** of names will still be matched.
  - `filter n/Udh` matches a person with the name "Udhaya".
- **Comprehensive searching**, returning all persons with names containing the keyphrase.
  - `filter n/Al` returns persons named "Alicia", "Allysa", "Jamal".

<u>Example:</u>

<a href="images/filter/filterByNameScreenshot.png">
<img src="images/filter/filterByNameScreenshot.png" alt="filterByNameScreenshot" style="width:150%">
</a>
<p align="center">
  <em> <code>filter n/Li</code> returns persons with names like "Charlotte Oliveiro" and "David Li"</em>
</p>

#### Filter By Tag
<u>Format:</u> `filter t/TAG`

- Returns the list of clients with the specified tag(s).
- Tag input should be valid and non-empty - "Buyer" or "Seller".
  - `filter t/buyer` matches person with tag "Buyer".
- **Inclusive matching** of persons with multiple tags, as long as they possess the
  tag(s) specified in the input.
  - `filter t/buyer` matches person with tags "Buyer" and "Seller".
- Supports searching with **multiple tags**.
  - `filter t/Buyer t/Seller` only returns persons with both "Buyer" and "Seller" tags.
- **Comprehensive searching**, returning all persons' with the specified tag(s).

<u>Examples:</u>
<p align="center">
      <a href="images/filter/filterByTagSeller.png">
      <img src="images/filter/filterByTagSeller.png" alt="filterByTagSeller" style="width:150%">
      </a>
  <em> <code>filter t/seller</code> returns persons with "Seller" Tag</em>
</p>
      <a href="images/filter/filterByTagBuyerSeller.png">
      <img src="images/filter/filterByTagBuyerSeller.png" alt="filterByTagBuyerSeller" style="width:150%">
      </a>

<p align="center">
  <em> <code>filter t/buyer t/seller</code> only returns persons with "Buyer" and "Seller" Tag</em>
</p>

#### Filter By Housing Type
<u>Format:</u> `filter h/HOUSING_TYPE`

- Returns the list of clients with the specified housing type preference.

  <img src="images/filter/filterByHousingType.png" alt="filterByHousingType" style="width:150%">
  </a>
<p align="center">
  <em> <code>filter h/Good Class Bungalow</code> returns persons with "Good Class Bungalow" Housing Type preference</em>
</p>

#### Filter By Remark
<u>Format:</u> `filter r/KEYPHRASE`

- Returns the list of clients whose remarks include the specified keyphrase.
- Keyphrase input should be non-empty. 
This is an intentional design choice to ensure that the command is used for targeted searches, preventing the potential misinterpretation of an empty keyphrase as a request to list all clients.
- Important: The remarks for the `filter r/` command must not contain any other prefixes to prevent parsing errors. 
> The command `filter r/ my tag is t/buyer` would cause an error because the system interprets `t/` as the start of a new prefix.
> To avoid this, ensure that the remark does not contain any spaces followed by slashes that could be misconstrued as additional prefixes.
  - `filter r/FOOD` matches person with remark "He loves food."
- **Partial fragments** of remarks will still be matched.
  - `filter r/hand` matches person with remark "handsome".
- **Comprehensive searching**, returning all persons' names containing the keyword .
  - `filter r/love` returns persons with remarks "loves to travel", "has a lovely dog".
    
<u>Example:</u>

  <a href="images/filter/filterByRemarkScreenshot.png">
    <img src="images/filter/filterByRemarkScreenshot.png" alt="filterByRemarkScreenshot" style="width:150%">
    </a>
<p align="center">
  <em> <code>filter r/eat</code> returns persons with remarks like "Eats alot" and "Likes to eat nasi lemak ..."</em>
</p>

#### Filter By Birthday
<u>Format:</u> `filter b/MONTH`

- Returns the list of clients whose birthdays are in the specified month.
- Month input should be a valid month in `MMM` format and non-empty.
  - Filtering by month "September" should be `filter b/Sep`
    - `filter b/SEP` matches person with Birthday in September.
- **Comprehensive searching**, returning all persons with birthdays in the specified month.
    - `filter b/Jan` returns all persons with birthday in January.
- Persons who do not have a specified birthday will **not be included** in the search results.

<u>Example:</u>

<a href="images/filter/filterByBirthday.png">
  <img src="images/filter/filterByBirthday.png" alt="filterByBirthday" style="width:150%">
  </a>

<p align="center">
  <em> <code>filter b/Apr</code> returns persons with Birthday in April</em>
</p>

<img src="images/misc_features/help_window.png" alt="help_window" style=" width: 900px; margin-bottom: 16px;">
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Help (Individual Commands) : `COMMAND help`

Shows the help message for the specified command only.

**Format:**
<box>COMMAND help</box>

<box type="info" header="Things to note:">

* Note that this feature is only available for the `add`,`clearRealodex`,`delete`,`edit`,`filter`,`list` and `sort` commands.
* Although the format is `COMMAND help`, the exception is the help message for the clear command.
  Use `clear help` instead of `clearRealodex help`.
  </box>

**Example:**
1. User types in `add help`.
2. Realodex posts the help message for `add` command as shown below.
<p align="center">
      <a href="images/misc_features/command_help.png">
      <img src="images/misc_features/command_help.png" alt="command_help" style="width:120%">
      </a>
</p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program and closes the window.

**Format:**
<box>exit</box>

<box type="info" header="Things to note:">

* Note that keying in `exit` followed by any random string, such as `exit wrelvwrvn` will also cause the app to exit.
  </box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### File Data

The JSON file that stores the data of your contacts can be found in a folder named `data`, in the same folder/directory as the Realodex app. (e.g. if you
have Realodex installed in your Desktop, the `data` folder containing the file can be found in your Desktop as well.)

#### Saving Data

Realodex data is saved in the hard disk as a JSON file automatically after any command that modifies it. There is no need to save manually.

#### Editing Data

Realodex data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/realodex.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your **manual changes to the data file makes its format invalid**, Realodex will **discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.**  Hence, it is recommended to make a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Realodex to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

#### Restarting with New Data
Should you want to re-enter your contacts in a fresh JSON file in the event of file corruption or a bad edit causing the format to be incorrect,
simply delete `realodex.json`, which can be found in the `data` folder, and restart the app. A new JSON file with sample contacts will be generated and you may proceed from there.

## Field Constraints
* NAME:
    * Should only contain Alphanumeric characters and must be unique.
    1. Names are case-insensitive.
  2. Number of spaces between words in the name do not matter.
  3. Although names are displayed in full capitalisation, they are still recorded in a case-insensitive manner. Hence, an input with the same name but different capitalisation will be considered a duplicate entry.
    * Example: `n/John Doe` and `n/john   doe` are both considered the same valid name but both will be displayed as `JOHN DOE`.
* PHONE:
    * Should only contain numbers, and should be at least 3 digits long.
    * Example: `p/81234567`
* INCOME:
    * Income should be an integer and should be at least 0.
    * Example: `i/20000`
* EMAIL:
    * Emails should be of the format local-part@domain and adhere to the following constraints:
    1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-).
    2. The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
    3. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.\
       The domain name must:
        * end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
        * have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
        * have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.
    * Example: `e/realodex-admin@gmail.com`
* ADDRESS: Current residential address
    * Must not include other command prefixes (`a/`,`b/`,`e/`,`f/`,`h/`,`i/`,`n/`,`p/`,`r/`,`t/`) to prevent parsing errors. For instance, `a/lemontree street t/1` may cause the command to fail, as the system will interpret `t/` as an unintended tag prefix.
    * Example: `a/6 College Ave West`
* FAMILY: Immediate family size
    * Should be an integer greater than 1.
    * Example: `f/4`
* TAG:
    * Only accept "buyer" or "seller" as the input (case-insensitive). Multiple tags are accepted.
    * Example: `t/buyer`, `t/seller` or both
* HOUSINGTYPE: housing type a buyer wants or housing type a seller is selling
    * Must be one of the following: "HDB", "CONDOMINIUM", "LANDED PROPERTY", "GOOD CLASS BUNGALOW" (case-insensitive). Only one housing type is allowed.
    * Example: `h/HDB`
* REMARK:
    * Can be empty if remark is not specified.
    * Must not include other command prefixes (`a/`, `b/`, `f/`, `h/`, `i/`, `n/`, `p/`, `r/`, `t/`) to prevent parsing errors. For instance, `r/Prefers block b/c` may cause the command to fail, as the system will interpret `b/` as an unintended birthday prefix.
    * Example: `r/Has a cat`
* BIRTHDAY:
    * Should be in the form "DDMMMYYYY", and can be empty if the birthday is not specified.
    * Example: `b/22Feb2002`
    1. The date must not be in the future.
    2. The date must exist in the Gregorian calendar. (`b/29Feb2023` is not allowed as it is not a valid day to begin with)
    3. The day "DD" must be numeric. For 1st-9th day of the month, the 0 need not be present. (Example: `2Feb2002`)
    4. The month "MMM" refers to the first 3 letters of the month (case-insensitive)
    5. The year "YYYY" must be in full and greater than or equal to 1000. (`b/29Feb02` is not allowed)

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty JSON file it creates with the JSON file that contains all of your data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
